      They have many primitive characteristics. Lampreys and hagfish are in this class. The earliest vertebrates. Don't have paired fins or a stomach. Adults and larvae have a notochord. A notochord is a flexible rod-like cord of cells that provides the main
      support for the body of an organism during its embryonic stage. Have a skeleton made of cartilage. They have a light sensitive pineal eye. A heart with two chambers.They are ectothermic. This means that their internal temperature depends on the
      temperature of their environment.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <a href="https://i.imgur.com/8RbS1J1.png">Respiration (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <li>Have 5 to 7 gill slits to diffuse oxygen. They suck water in through the pharynx and release water through the filtering gill slits.</li>
      <a href="https://i.imgur.com/J5KDxCF.jpg">Reproduction (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <li>Agnatha use external fertilization and are oviparous. The babies develop in eggs in water.</li>
      <li> Most species are hermaphrodites. In the larval stage they are filter feeders. They spend 5 to 6 year as larva from their 7 year life span.</li>
      <a href="https://i.imgur.com/koVLTnJ.jpg">Circulation (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <li>There is a two chambered heart with single circulation. Have an atrium and ventricle. Heart pumps to the gills to release the waste.</li>
      <li>They have a closed circulatory system</li>
      <a href="https://i.imgur.com/8RbS1J1.png">Excretory (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <li>Have a kidney to filter waste and sned it to the anus for release. Kidneys also play a key role in keeping the amount of salt in their body regulated.</li>
      <li>When the fish is in salt water, the fish's gills work to keep excess salt out.</li>
      <a href="https://i.imgur.com/YD5s5ab.jpg">Digestive (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <li>Since agnatha are parasitic they get food from their host's blood. This blood goes directly to the intestines since they technically don't have a stomach to digest. In the mouth the release enzymes into the blood to prevent clotting.</li>
      <li> Filter feeders as larva and parasitic as adults. </li>
      <li>Once finished digesting all the nutrients from the blood the blood exits through a small hole in the rear of the animal.</li>
      <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Pognh5Z.jpg">Nervous system (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <li>Have a brain that connects to a spinal chord. They have a peripheral nervous system with brain nerves and spine nerves. The animals have two eyes that are not very developed but can sense some light in the water.
    </ul>

      <h1>Cartilaginous Fish (Chondrichthyes)</h1>
    </center>

    <p>Cartilaginous Fish have a skeleton made from cartilage instead of bone. Cartilage is tough and flexible and provides enough structural support. The tough skin of skates and rays is covered with dermal teeth (dermal denticles). This gives the skin
      a rough feel to it. In most species, dermal denticles are pointed in one direction, making the skin feel very smooth if rubbed in one direction and very rough if rubbed in the other. These teeth provide protection. Cartilaginous fish all breathe
      through 5 to 7 gills, depending on the species. Open water species must keep swimming to keep oxygenated water moving through their gills. However, deep sea species can actively pump water in through their spiracles and out through their gills.
      A cartilaginous fish's skin is covered in placoid scales, or dermal denticles.</p>
    <ul>
      <a href="https://i.imgur.com/8RbS1J1.png">Respiration (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <li>They extract oxygen from seawater as it passes over their gills.</li>
      <li>A modified slit called a spiracle lies just behind the eye. This process is known as "ram ventilation". The fish pretty much use filtration like the animals in the Porifera phylum.</li>
      <a href="https://i.imgur.com/J5KDxCF.jpg">Reproduction (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <li>All cartilaginous fish reproduce using internal fertilization. The male uses "claspers" to grasp the female, and then he releases sperm to fertilize the female's oocytes. The zygotea are nourished by a placenta, yolk sac, unfertilized egg capsules,
        or even by feeding on other young fish.</li>
      <a href="https://i.imgur.com/koVLTnJ.jpg">Circulation (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <li> Cartilage fish have a closed loop circulatory system. The heart is two-chambered. The heart has an atrium and ventricle. The blood is pumped by the heart through the branched arteries to capillaries in the gills, where the blood is oxygenated. To
        circulate blood throughout their bodies, the fish must swim continuously.</li>
      <a href="https://i.imgur.com/8RbS1J1.png">Excretory (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <li>They store large amounts of urea in their blood. The concentration of their blood is slightly greater than the surrounding sea water, and water does not enter by osmosis. Special cells in the rectal gland of these fish excrete whatever excess salt
        does enter the system.</li>
      <a href="https://i.imgur.com/YD5s5ab.jpg">Digestive (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <li></li>
      <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Pognh5Z.jpg">Nervous system (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <li>They have well-developed sense organs. Eyes are usually large and well-developed. Their vision is adapted for low light, nocturnal activity or deep-water conditions, and poor color definition. Their sense of smell is well-developed. They have fairly
        simple brains compared to those of large, advanced mammals</li>

      <h1>Bony Fish (Osteichthyes)</h1>
    </center>
    <center><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Clown_fish_in_the_Andaman_Coral_Reef.jpg/1024px-Clown_fish_in_the_Andaman_Coral_Reef.jpg" height="250px" width="400px"></center>
    <p>Including the great majority of living fishes and virtually all the worldâ€™s sport and commercial fishes. Skeleton at least partly composed of true bone. The presence of a swim bladder (an air-filled sac to give buoyancy), operculum over the gill chamber,
      bony platelike scales, a skull with sutures, and external fertilization of eggs. Occur in all freshwater and ocean environments, including caves, deep-sea habitats, and thermal springs and vents. Lateral line that runs across the side of their body.
      The lateral line is a series of sensory organs called neuromasts that helps bony fish sense vibrations and water pressure and help fish navigate and locate prey. </p>
    <ul>
      <a href="https://i.imgur.com/8RbS1J1.png">Respiration (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <li>Water contains dissolved molecules of oxygen that the fish are able to use for respiration, just as humans are able to use the oxygen in the air. Fish have a very specific organ in order to extract oxygen from the water, as well as expel carbon
        dioxide back into it. This organ is called the gills. When fish take in water through their mouths, the outer cover of their gills, called an operculum, closes, to help keep that water in their bodies. The swallowed water passes into their gill
        area, where it comes in contact with the gill filaments.</li>
      <li>Hemoglobin containing iron which is highly reactive to oxygen. Hemoglobin will absorb less oxygen at lower pH. As fish swim they can open their mouths and use some of the flowing water to move the oxygen-containing water through the gills.</li>
      <li>Within the gill filaments, blood flows in the opposite direction of the incoming water. This helps with the oxygenation.</li>
      <a href="https://i.imgur.com/J5KDxCF.jpg">Reproduction (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <li>Oviparous and lay eggs. The female releases thousand of minute eggs into the water where they are fertilized externally by sperm produced by the male and develop into small fish. Parental care is rare in fishes but occurs in pipe fishes and sea
        horses (Family Syngnathidae). In this family, the females place their eggs in the male's pouch. The males brood the eggs until the young hatch and can swim actively when he expels them into the water.</li>
      <a href="https://i.imgur.com/koVLTnJ.jpg">Circulation (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <li>The circuit is a "closed system". A bony fish's heart has two chambers: an atrium and a ventricle.</li>
      <a href="https://i.imgur.com/8RbS1J1.png">Excretory (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <li>is the kidney. In fishes some excretion also takes place in the digestive tract, skin, and especially the gills (where ammonia is given off). most fish release their nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. Some of the wastes diffuse through the gills. Blood
        wastes are filtered by the kidneys.</li>
      <a href="https://i.imgur.com/YD5s5ab.jpg">Digestive (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <li>The esophagus in bony fishes is short and expandable so that large objects can be swallowed. The esophagus walls are layered with muscle. Most species of bony fishes have a stomach. Gastric glands release substances that break down food to prepare
        it for digestion. blind sacs called pyloric caeca. The pyloric caeca are an adaptation for increasing the gut area; they digest food. pancreas secretes enzymes into the intestine for digestion. Most food absorption takes place in the intestine.
        Comes out the anus.</li>
      <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Pognh5Z.jpg">Nervous system (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <li>A bony fish's brain is divided into three sections: the forebrain, the midbrain, and the hindbrain. The spinal cord and a matrix of nerves serve the rest of the body.
