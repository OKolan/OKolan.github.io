      <h1>Mammals</h1>
    </center>
    <p>Have a skeleton made from cartilage instead of bone. Cartilage is tough and flexible and provides enough structural support to allow these fish to grow to very large sizes. The tough skin of skates and rays is covered with dermal teeth (dermal denticles)
      making it feel like sandpaper. In most species, all dermal denticles are pointed in one direction, making the skin feel very smooth if rubbed in one direction and very rough if rubbed in the other. Denticles provide protection. Rays are live bearing
      (viviparous) while skates are egg laying (oviparous). Cartilaginous fish all breathe through 5 to 7 gills, depending on the species. In general, open water (pelagic} species must keep swimming to keep oxygenated water moving through their gills
      whilst bottom-dwelling (demersal) species can actively pump water in through their spiracles and out through their gills. A cartilaginous fish's skin is covered in placoid scales, or dermal denticles, tooth-like scales different from the flat scales
      (called ganoid, ctenoid or cycloid) found on bony fish.</p>
      <a href="https://imgur.com/a/sTjR1eR">Respiratory (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <ul>
      <li>Mammals have well developed lungs. Inhalation begins the cycle when air enters
the nasal cavity and then its warmed by the body temperature and humidified. The respiratory
tract, being coated with mucus seals the tissues from direct contact with the air and as the air
passes the mucous membranes it picks up water. Essentially what mammals have is, lungs that
filter the air to make it the temperature of the body to prevent damage. They also have filters to
make sure the air they take in donâ€™t damage the respiratory system. Air is then passed to the
pharynx and the larynx to the trachea. While going through, small hairs filter the air. Mammals 
have 2 lungs and each lung contains alveoli (where gas exchange occurs). Mammals use
negative pressure breathing which is pulling air into their lungs instead of pushing.</li> 
      </ul>
      <a href="https://imgur.com/a/g3RkX1C">Circulation (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <ul>
      <li>Mammals have the most complex circulatory systems. Mammals have a heart divided into 4 chambers which is made up of 2 atria and 2 ventricles. The right atrium receives blood from the superior and inferior vena cavas and the coronary sinus. Then, the blood moves to the right ventricle and is pumped to the lungs. The lungs put oxygen back into the lungs and sends it to the left atrium where it then moves to the left ventricle using the bicuspid valve. The blood then moves out of the left ventricle to the aorta which sends the blood around the blood.</li>
      </ul>
      <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Hw0fPl8">Excretion (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <ul>
      <li>Mammals have kidneys made of units called nephrons. Each nephron has a portion
called the loop of Henle or nephritic loop. These loops give the ability to make urine with higher
concentration of solutes (even higher than that of the blood). Mammals don't have a renal portal
system. This is a system of veins that moves blood from the posterior end of the mammal to the
kidneys. Every vertebrate (except Jawless Fish) have this. Every mammal has a urinary bladder
which stores urine.</li>
      </ul>
      <a href="https://imgur.com/a/QtXykFl">Digestion (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <ul>
      <li>Mammals possess a complete digestive tract. Digestive tracts vary based on what
the animal eats but for the most part, they are very similar. Herbivores possess elongated
intestines and specialized stomachs. The stomach can also have subdivisions based on where the
animal lives and what it eats. For example, some animals may have subdivisions for different
kinds of symbiotic bacteria which help the animal break down otherwise indigestible compounds.</li>
      </ul>
      <a href="https://imgur.com/a/FgFLeWg">Nervous System (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <ul>
      <li>The brains of mammals are complex, allowing them a variety of responses. Mammals have better cerebral hemispheres allowing them more responses to stimuli. Members in this class have the ability to learn, adapt to different scenarios and behaviors not seen in other animals. Many animals have similar behaviors and physiological functions. The nervous system is split into the central and peripheral nervous systems. The peripheral nervous system control volitional and nonvolitional behaviors using cranial and spinal nerves. The central nervous system is made of the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain with each unit performing a variety of tasks. It is difficult to sum up the nervous system of mammals as many of them are very different due to their varying levels of senses. </li>

      <h1>Monotremes</h1>

      <a href="">Reproduction (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <ul>
      <li>The rarest of all mammals, are the Monotremes. Home to only three species, monotremes are the only known mammals to give birth to their young in eggs. Like reptiles, monotremes lay their young in eggs, but unlike reptiles the eggs are retained for some time within the mother, who actively provides the egg with nutrients.The Duck-Billed Platypus and two species of Echidna are found only in the continent of Australia.</li>

      <a href="">Reproduction (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <ul>
      <li>Marsupials are the group of mammals commonly thought of as pouched mammals, but the pouch is more complex than most think. This sub class is home to 260 species of known marsupials. Like most other mammals, marsupials give live birth, but have much shorter gestation periods than placental mammals. Instead, they give birth much earlier and the young animal, pretty much a helpless embryo, climbs from the mother's birth canal to the mother's pouch. Inside of the pouch are the mother's nipples, to which the embryo attaches to and remains until it is a mature juvenile.</li>

      <h1>Placental Mammals</h1>
    </center>
    <center><img src="https://atgbcentral.com/data/out/134/5135859-tiger-image.jpg" height="250px" width="400px"></center>
      <a href="">Reproduction (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <ul>
      <li>Placental mammals all bear live young, which are nourished before birth in the mother's uterus through a specialized embryonic organ attached to the uterus wall, called the placenta. The embryo develops over a long gestation period, and emerges from the womb fully formed. Monotremes and Marsupials have placentae as well, but they have little function in these different mammals.</li>
