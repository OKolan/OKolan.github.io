    <p>Have a skeleton made from cartilage instead of bone. Cartilage is tough and flexible and provides enough structural support to allow these fish to grow to very large sizes. The tough skin of skates and rays is covered with dermal teeth (dermal denticles)
      making it feel like sandpaper. In most species, all dermal denticles are pointed in one direction, making the skin feel very smooth if rubbed in one direction and very rough if rubbed in the other. Denticles provide protection. Rays are live bearing
      (viviparous) while skates are egg laying (oviparous). Cartilaginous fish all breathe through 5 to 7 gills, depending on the species. In general, open water (pelagic} species must keep swimming to keep oxygenated water moving through their gills
      whilst bottom-dwelling (demersal) species can actively pump water in through their spiracles and out through their gills. A cartilaginous fish's skin is covered in placoid scales, or dermal denticles, tooth-like scales different from the flat scales
      (called ganoid, ctenoid or cycloid) found on bony fish.</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Marsupials are born with immature lungs and have to rely on cutaneous gas exchange. Cutaneous gas exchange is using the skin to breath through diffusion. Newborn marsupials do not rely on their lungs as they are relatively undeveloped and unable to provide enough oxygen needed for the young marsupials. Therefore marsupials will rely on skin gas exchange for the early stages of their lives for breathing. When their lungs are fully developed, they will rely on them. In marsupials as well as many other mammals, air will be inhaled through the trachea and into the lungs to the bronchi. The bronchi has smaller branches called bronchioles which include small air sacs called alveoli. Oxygen is absorbed in the alveoli. The oxygen will be absorbed into the blood and carbon dioxide will travel from the blood to the alveoli to be breathed out since it is a waste product.</li>
      </ul>
      <a href="">Reproduction (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <ul>
      <li>Marsupials are the group of mammals commonly thought of as pouched mammals, but the pouch is more complex than most think. This sub class is home to 260 species of known marsupials. Like most other mammals, marsupials give live birth, but have much shorter gestation periods than placental mammals. Instead, they give birth much earlier and the young animal, pretty much a helpless embryo, climbs from the mother's birth canal to the mother's pouch. Inside of the pouch are the mother's nipples, to which the embryo attaches to and remains until it is a mature juvenile.</li>
      </ul>
      <a href="">Circulation (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <ul>
      <li>All marsupials have a four chambered heart. Their right side is used to pump blood without oxygen from the body to the lungs while the left side pumps blood with oxygen from the lungs to the body. The blood without oxygen is carried throughout the body through veins and the blood with a lot of oxygen is carried through arteries. Oxygen deprived

blood will come to the right atrium and through the right ventricle and to the lungs where carbon dioxide will be released. As carbon dioxide is released, oxygen will be absorbed. When oxygen is absorbed, the lungs will send the oxygen rich blood to the left atrium where it will travel through the left ventricle to the body.</li>
      </ul>
      <a href="">Excretion (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <ul>
      <li>When an organism, like marsupials, catabolizes amino acids in the body it creates nitrogenous wastes. These wastes are very toxic and need to be eliminated. Marsupials have an orifice called the cloaca from which they excrete both feces and urine. In order to eliminate the wastes, the organism consumes water to to make the wastes soluble and easier to get rid of.</li>
      </ul>
      <a href="">Digestive (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <ul>
      <li>Marsupials consist of carnivores, omnivores, foregut fermenters and hindgut fermenters. Foregut fermenters and hindgut fermenters are both herbivores but they are very different in the way they digest things.

FOREGUT FERMENTERS-

Foregut fermenters may also be referred to as ruminants. They have a different way of digesting food which is slower but allows for a greater nutrients yield without wasting a lot of energy. Foregut ferments contain pouches with microbes in their stomach. These microbes take glucose from cellulose while producing fatty acids that will be used for energy. Well known marsupial foregut fermenters would be organisms such as kangaroos and wallabies.

HINDGUT FERMENTERS-

Hindgut fermenters use their caecum and proximal colon in their hindgut for fermentation. Within the caecum and proximal colon are microbes to help digest the food. Hindgut fermentation is a lot less efficient at digesting food when compared to foregut fermenters. Some even have to eat their feces because of this.</li>
      </ul>
      <a href="">Nervous System (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <ul>
      <li>Marsupials have nervous systems similar to many mammals, with the exception of a few characteristics. Marsupials have a very complex nervous system. Their nervous system works with the senses to transmit information to the brain, a process that takes less than one-hundredth of a second. Their brains are wired to react quickly in order to protect themselves from danger and to allow it to assess immediate environment easily. Marsupials, just like humans, have nerve endings spread throughout their whole bodies that allow them to respond to stimuli. Their nervous system is composed of neurons and glial cells. In the central nervous system, which is the brain and spinal cord, the neurons have dendrites which carry bioelectrical impulses to the cell body. The second group of cells are the glial cells. These type of cells are located in the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system, however, the glial cells include astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and schwann cells. Astrocytes help transport nutrients to neurons. While schwann cells and oligodendrocytes help produce collagen and other extracellular molecules which form a cuff of basal lamina around each peripheral nerve axon.</li>

      <li>Placental mammals all bear live young, which are nourished before birth in the mother's uterus through a specialized embryonic organ attached to the uterus wall, called the placenta. The embryo develops over a long gestation period, and emerges from the womb fully formed. Monotremes and Marsupials have placentae as well, but they have little function in these different mammals.</li>
