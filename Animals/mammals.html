    <h2>
    *Reproduction is seperate for each mammal so scroll down to see reproduction info about each class*
    </h2>
    <p> In Mammals the young are nourished with milk from special mammary glands of the mother. Mammals have several other unique features that are very noticeable. Hair is a typical mammalian feature, although in many whales it has disappeared except in the fetal stage. The mammalian lower jaw is hinged directly to the skull. A chain of three tiny bones transmit sound waves across the middle ear. A muscular diaphragm separates the heart and the lungs from the abdominal cavity. Mature red blood cells in all mammals lack a nucleus; all other vertebrates have nucleated red blood cells. Except for monotremes all mammals are viviparous which means they bear live young. </p>
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/sTjR1eR">Respiratory (Link to Diagram)</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Mammals have well developed lungs that are very powerful and are the mammals main source of respiration. The mammal inhales and the cycle begins when air enters the nasal cavity and then its warmed by the body temperature and humidified. The respiratory tract, being coated with mucus covers the tissues from direct contact with
        the air and as the air passes the mucous membranes it picks up water. Mammals have lungs that filter the air to make it the temperature of the body to prevent damage. They also have filters to make sure the air they take in
        donâ€™t damage the respiratory system. Air is then passed to the pharynx and the larynx to the trachea. While going through, small hairs filter the air. Mammals have 2 lungs and each lung contains alveoli (where gas exchange occurs). Mammals use
        negative pressure breathing which is pulling air into their lungs instead of pushing which is done by utilizing the diaphragm.</li>
    </ul>
     <a href="https://imgur.com/a/g3RkX1C">Circulation (Link to Diagram)</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Mammals have the most complex circulatory systems.</li>
      <li>Mammals have a heart divided into 4 chambers which is made up of 2 atria and 2 ventricles. The right atrium receives blood from the superior and inferior vena cavas and the coronary sinus. Then,
        the blood moves to the right ventricle and is pumped to the lungs. The lungs put oxygen back into the lungs and sends it to the left atrium where it then moves to the left ventricle using the different valves in the heart. The blood then moves out of the left
        ventricle to the aorta which sends the blood around the blood.</li>
    </ul>
    <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Hw0fPl8">Excretion (Link to Diagram)</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Mammals have kidneys to filter out blood. The kidneys filter chemicals that could be harmful in order to pass them down to the excretory system for removal. Mammals don't have a renal portal system. This is a system of veins that moves blood from the posterior end of the mammal to the kidneys. Every vertebrate (except Jawless Fish) have this. Every mammal has a urinary bladder which stores urine.</li>
    </ul>
    <a href="https://imgur.com/a/QtXykFl">Digestion (Link to Diagram)</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Mammals possess a complete digestive tract. Digestive tracts vary based on what the animal eats but for the most part, they are very similar. Herbivores possess elongated intestines and specialized stomachs. The stomach can also have subdivisions
        based on where the animal lives and what it eats. For example, some animals may have subdivisions for different kinds of symbiotic bacteria which help the animal break down otherwise indigestible compounds.</li>
    </ul>
    <a href="https://imgur.com/a/FgFLeWg">Nervous System (Link to Diagram)</a>
    <ul>
      <li>The brains of mammals are complex, allowing them a variety of responses. Mammals have better cerebral hemispheres allowing them to respond to even the slightest amount of stimuli.</li>
      <li>Members in this class have the ability to learn, adapt to different scenarios and behaviors
        not seen in other animals. Many animals have similar behaviors and physiological functions.</li>
        <li>The nervous system is split into the central and peripheral nervous systems. The peripheral nervous system controls muscle and joint behaviour using cranial and spinal nerves. The central nervous system is made of the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain with each unit performing a variety of tasks. It is difficult to sum up the nervous system of mammals as many of them are very different
        due to their varying levels of senses. </li>

      <h1>Monotremes</h1>

    <center><img src="https://media.wired.com/photos/5932525926780e6c04d2aefe/master/w_1280,c_limit/Echidna_Tachyglossus_aculeatus_setosus.jpg" height="200px" width="400px"></center>
    <a href="https://imgur.com/a/LmNWR87">Reproduction (Link to Diagram)</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Monotremes are the rarest mammals on the planet. Home to only three species, monotremes are the only known mammals to give birth to their young in eggs. Like reptiles, monotremes lay their young in eggs however, the eggs are retained for
        some time within the mother, who actively provides the egg with nutrients.The Duck-Billed Platypus and two species of Echidna are found only in the continent of Australia.</li>

      <h1>Marsupials</h1>

    <a href="https://imgur.com/a/YyKSg5Z">Reproduction (Link to Diagram)</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Marsupials are the group of mammals commonly thought of as pouched mammals, but the pouch is more complex than most think. This sub class is home to 260 species of known marsupials. Like most other mammals, marsupials give live birth, but have much
        shorter gestation periods than placental mammals. Instead, they give birth much earlier and the young animal, pretty much a helpless embryo, climbs from the mother's birth canal to the mother's pouch. Inside of the pouch are the mother's nipples,
        to which the embryo attaches to and remains until it is a mature juvenile.</li>

        <h1>Placental Mammals</h1>

      <a href="https://imgur.com/a/YyKSg5Z">Reproduction (Link to Diagram)</a>
      <ul>
        <li>Placental mammals all bear live young, which are nourished before birth in the mother's uterus through a specialized embryonic organ attached to the uterus wall, called the placenta. The embryo develops over a long gestation period, and emerges
          from the womb fully formed. Monotremes and Marsupials have placentae as well, but they have little function in these different mammals.</li>

      Evolutionary Changes from Aves to Mammals
      </h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Mammals, on the other hand, are warm-blooded, generating their heat internally, retaining it by insulation of fur and/or fat. Having a more consistent body temperature means a more continuous activity level.</li>
      <li>A more efficient metabolism is required which includes greater oxygen intake abilities and nutrient uptake.  Larger lungs, diaphragm, a four-chambered heart, and improved circulatory systems were the result.</li>
      <li>Improvements to the kidneys and the separation of the urinary and fecal excretory tracts (which are still combined in the monotremes.</li>
      <li>Evolved the system of reproduction which leaves the young to develop more fully inside the mother.  After birth, the young are given extended parental care by the reliable provision of the mother's mammary glands.  Thus, the young can spend its energy in further physiological growth, rather than having to be immediately able to hunt and defend itself.</li>
      <li>Mammals have a 4 chambered heart with 2 atria and 2 ventricles just like aves. However they have a very powerful diaphragm with detailed alveoli. </li>
      <li>Mammals evolved from a group of reptiles called the synapsids.</li>
