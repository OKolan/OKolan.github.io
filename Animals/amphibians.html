      <h1>Amphibians</h1>
    </center>
    <center><h3>*Please note that the subheadings (Respiration, Circulation) are links to diagrams of the animals systems*</h3></center>
    <center><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/uktv/image/upload/b_rgb:000000,w_654,c_fill,q_90,h_367/v1372350283/oglswajafw736r2dtacp.jpg" height="200px" width="400px"></center>
    <p>They spend time both in water and on land. Larvae mature in water and breathe through gills, like fish, while adults breathe air through lungs and skin. Amphibians are in the class Amphibia, which includes over 3,500 species. They have moist, scaleless
      skin that absorbs water and oxygen. Amphibians are most often found near ponds, marshlands, swamps, and other areas where freshwater is available. Amphibians become inactive when conditions are harsh. This is called estivation.</p>
    <ul>
      <a href="https://i.imgur.com/6BwRYHd.gif">Respiration</a>
      <li>Amphibians have cutaneous respiration which is when amphibians rely heavily on their moist skin for gas exchange with the environment. Although amphibians have lungs there a quite limited and not evolved fully. They can do little breathing through
        the lungs since they are too weak. The process to push air down throat to the lungs is called buccal pumping. In the larvae stage gas exchange occurs through the skin as well as the gills. Lungs are then produced during adulthood and they can
        start breathing through their mouths.</li>
      <a href="https://i.imgur.com/lXdRFOV.jpg">Reproduction</a>
      <li>Amphibians reproduce sexually with either external or internal fertilization. Amphibians do not produce amniotic eggs, they must lay their eggs in water so they wonâ€™t dry out. Their eggs are usually covered in a jelly-like substance. The jelly helps
        keep the eggs moist and offers some protection from predators. Amphibians use different calls and smells in order to attract other to mate with. The larvae mature in water since they do not have lungs. Once matured with lungs and limbs the animal
        moves to land.</li>
      <a href="https://i.imgur.com/EkkOMOt.jpg">Circulatory</a>
      <li>Most amphibians have 3 chambered hearts. Two atria and one ventricle. In larvae the heart is two chambered like in fish. However, as amphibians mature it develops into a 3 chambered heart. The heart has a double loop. The first loop transports blood
        with no oxygen to the heart and the second pump transports oxygen filled blood to the rest of the body.</li>
      <a href="https://i.imgur.com/nxJOP90.jpg">Excretory</a>
      <li>The kidneys filter wastes from the blood. The product created by the kidneys is nitrogen waste (ammonia). They then convert it into urea and the urea is excreted through urine. Waste matter is excreted through the cloacal openings.
        <!--Urea is a colorless crystaline compund-->
      </li>
      <a href="https://i.imgur.com/uzI8Ns5.jpg">Digestive</a>
      <li>Amphibians do not chew even though they have minature teeth in their mouth. The food flows from its mouth to its esophagus to its stomach. Digestion begins in the stomach of an amphibian. Food then moves through the small intestine. Enzymes from
        the pancreas start the digestion process. From the small intestine, nutrients from the food are absorbed into the bloodstream and delivered to body cells. The food proceeds to the large intestine. Then it moves to the cloaca for removal.</li>
      <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Oh5amGy.jpg">Nervous System</a>
      <li>Amphibians have a central brain, a spinal cord, and nerves throughout the body. However, the brain is very under developed compared to other vertabrates. The brain has a cerebrum, midbrain, and cerebellum. The olfactory lobe controls the sense of
        smell. The optic lobe receives and goes through information from the eyes. The cerebellum is in control of muscular coordination. The brain sends signals through the spinal cord and nerves to regulate activity in the rest of the body.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Evolutionary Chnages from Fish</h2>
    <li>Amphibians are the first group to develop limbs in order to walk on land. They also developed lungs in order so they can breathe on land by getting oxygen from the air rather tha filtering it from water. Fish did not have limbs or lungs.</li>
    <li>Amphibians also developed choanes which are inner nostrils that connect to the lungs and mouth. Fish had external nostrils which just let water pass through and no apparant choanes.</li>
    <li>Amphibians developed a way too fertilize eggs internally inside the female. This was not present in fish. The fish had to leave their eggs in the water in hopes for fertilization.</li>
